= SUSE Observability Agent supported architectures

Please note that SUSE Observability is designed and tested to run on specific hardware architectures. Installation and operation are exclusively supported on systems utilizing one of the following processor architectures:

* `x86_64` (also known as AMD64 or Intel 64)
