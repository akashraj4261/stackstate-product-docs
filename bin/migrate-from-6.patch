 = Migrating from StackState 6.x to SUSE Observability
 :description: SUSE Observability Self-hosted
+:page-toclevels: 3
 
 Due to the rename of the product and also due to breaking changes in the topology data format it is not possible to upgrade from StackState to SUSE Observability via a standard Helm upgrade command. This migration guide will help you set up SUSE Observability exactly the same as StackState.

 Uninstalling StackState before installing SUSE Observability has 2 advantages, first of all it frees up resources in the cluster, so no temporary extra nodes are needed. Second, it removes the ingress configuration for StackState freeing up the StackState URL to be re-used by SUSE Observability. The only disadvantage is there will be a period from this point until setting up the configuration of SUSE Observability where you won't have monitoring available with StackState nor SUSE Observability.
 
 Uninstalling StackState will also remove your historical data (topology and all other telemetry data too). To uninstall StackState follow the https://docs.stackstate.com/6.0/self-hosted-setup/uninstall[uninstallation docs].

 In this scenario SUSE Observability will ingest new data and it is responsible to run monitors and send out notifications. StackState will only offer access to the historical data.
 
 At some point traffic will need to be switched over from StackState to SUSE Observability. The solution that limits the impact on your users and the installed agents is to configure SUSE Observability with the URL originally used by StackState. This guide will re-use the StackState URL (`stackstate.demo.stackstate.io`) while the "old" StackState will be accessible under a new `stackstate-old.demo.stackstate.io` URL. When using an OIDC provider for authentication the `stackstate-old` URL will need to be add/updated in the OIDC provider configuration and in the StackState configuration.

+==== Prepare to scale down StackState
 
 To make sure nothing changes anymore in the old "StackState" setup and also to reduce its resource usage a number of StackState deployments must be scaled down to 0 replicas. The best way to do this is via the Helm values, in that way any other configuration change will not accidentally scale up some of the deployments again.

 Re-routing the traffic will switch both agent traffic and users of StackState to SUSE Observability.

In between these steps SUSE Observability/StackState will temporarily be inaccessible, but the agents will cache the data and send it when they can connect again.
